# SAP B1 Connection Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue Fixed: GRPO Not Posting to SAP B1

### Root Cause
The GRPO approval function was only simulating SAP B1 posting instead of actually connecting to SAP B1. This has been fixed.

### Changes Made
1. **Updated GRPO Approval Route** (`modules/grpo/routes.py`):
   - Removed simulation code
   - Added real SAP B1 integration call
   - Enhanced error handling and logging

2. **Created SAP Connection Test** (`test_sap_connection.py`):
   - Tests server reachability
   - Validates login credentials
   - Checks API access permissions

## Current SAP B1 Configuration
Based on your `.env` file:
- **Server**: https://192.168.1.5:50000
- **Username**: manager
- **Password**: Ea@12345
- **Company DB**: Test_Hutchinson

## Testing Your SAP Connection

### Quick Test (Command Line)
```bash
python test_sap_connection.py
```

### Expected Results
‚úÖ **If connection works**:
- Server reachable
- Login successful
- API access confirmed
- Purchase Orders accessible

‚ùå **If connection fails**:
- Check network connectivity to 192.168.1.5
- Verify SAP B1 Service Layer is running
- Confirm credentials are correct

## How GRPO Posting Now Works

### New Flow:
1. User clicks "Post to SAP B1" button
2. System validates QC approval
3. **Real SAP integration** creates Purchase Delivery Note
4. GRPO status updates to "posted"
5. SAP document number is saved

### What Gets Posted:
- **Document Type**: Purchase Delivery Note
- **Reference**: Original Purchase Order
- **Items**: Only QC-approved items
- **Quantities**: Received quantities
- **Batch Numbers**: If applicable

## Debugging Failed Posts

### Check Application Logs
Look for these log messages:
- `üöÄ Attempting to post GRPO X to SAP B1...`
- `üì° SAP B1 posting result: {...}`
- `‚úÖ GRPO X QC approved and posted to SAP B1`

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### 1. Connection Timeout
```
Error: SAP B1 not available
```
**Solution**: Check network connectivity and SAP B1 server status

#### 2. Authentication Failed
```
Error: SAP B1 login failed
```
**Solution**: Verify username, password, and company database name

#### 3. Permission Denied
```
Error: Access denied to Purchase Delivery Notes
```
**Solution**: Ensure SAP B1 user has permissions to create delivery notes

#### 4. Purchase Order Not Found
```
Error: Purchase Order XXX not found in SAP B1
```
**Solution**: Verify PO exists and is open in SAP B1

## Manual Verification

After posting, verify in SAP B1:
1. Open **Purchase Delivery Notes** module
2. Search for document created with today's date
3. Check reference to original Purchase Order
4. Verify quantities and item details match GRPO

## Next Steps

1. **Test the connection** using the test script
2. **Try posting a GRPO** and check the logs
3. **Verify in SAP B1** that the document was created
4. **Report any specific errors** for further troubleshooting

The GRPO posting functionality is now properly integrated with your SAP B1 system!
