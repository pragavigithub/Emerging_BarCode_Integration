# ðŸš¨ URGENT: Inventory Transfer Database Fix

## The Problem
Your local database is missing the new QC approval columns that were added to the inventory transfer functionality.

## ðŸ”§ IMMEDIATE FIX - Choose ONE option:

### Option 1: Quick Database Reset (RECOMMENDED for SQLite)
```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd "E:\SAP_Integ\Git Change\20250717\1\Emerging_BarCode_Integration"

# Delete the old database file
del instance\warehouse.db

# Or if it's in the root directory:
del warehouse.db

# Restart your Flask application
python app.py
```

### Option 2: Run the Migration Script (SUPPORTS MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite)
```bash
# Run the migration script I created
python migrate_inventory_transfers.py
```

### Option 3: Manual SQL Fix (SUPPORTS MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite)
```bash
# Run the quick fix script
python fix_inventory_transfer_schema.py
```

### Option 4: Switch to MySQL (NEW!)
```bash
# Set up MySQL database
python setup_mysql_local.py

# Then run the migration
python migrate_inventory_transfers.py
```

## ðŸ“‹ What This Fixes

The migration adds these missing columns:
- `qc_approver_id` - ID of QC approver
- `qc_approved_at` - Timestamp of QC approval
- `qc_notes` - QC approval notes
- `from_warehouse` - Source warehouse
- `to_warehouse` - Destination warehouse

## âœ… After Running the Fix

1. Restart your Flask application
2. Navigate to Inventory Transfer module
3. The error should be resolved
4. You'll now have the new QC approval workflow

## ðŸ”„ New Workflow Available

- **Users**: Submit transfers for QC approval
- **QC Staff**: Access `/qc_dashboard` to approve/reject transfers
- **Auto-posting**: Approved transfers automatically post to SAP B1

## ðŸ†˜ If Fix Doesn't Work

1. Check if you have write permissions to the database file
2. Ensure no other Flask processes are running
3. Try Option 1 (database reset) - it's the most reliable

## ðŸ“ž Need Help?

The fix scripts are designed to be safe and handle all common scenarios. Option 1 (database reset) is recommended because it ensures you have the latest schema with all features.
