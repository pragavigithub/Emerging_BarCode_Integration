# Mobile App Setup for WMS

## Progressive Web App (PWA) - Already Implemented

The WMS application is already configured as a Progressive Web App (PWA) that works on mobile devices:

### Features:
- **Installable**: Users can install the app on their mobile devices
- **Offline Capability**: Works without internet connection
- **Camera Access**: Barcode scanning using device camera
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for mobile screens
- **Push Notifications**: Service worker support for notifications

### How to Use on Mobile:

1. **Android/iOS Browser**:
   - Open the app URL in Chrome/Safari
   - Look for "Add to Home Screen" or "Install" prompt
   - Tap "Add" to install the app

2. **Direct Installation**:
   - The app will appear as a native app on your home screen
   - Launch it like any other mobile app

### Mobile Features:
- ✓ Barcode scanning with camera
- ✓ Touch-friendly interface
- ✓ Offline data storage
- ✓ Full warehouse management functions
- ✓ Real-time SAP B1 integration

## Native Mobile App Alternative

If you need a native mobile app, here are the options:

### Option 1: Capacitor (Recommended)
```bash
npm install -g @capacitor/cli
npx cap init WMS com.company.wms
npx cap add android
npx cap add ios
npx cap sync
```

### Option 2: PhoneGap/Cordova
```bash
npm install -g cordova
cordova create wms-mobile com.company.wms WMS
cd wms-mobile
cordova platform add android
cordova platform add ios
```

### Option 3: Flutter (Requires Dart)
```bash
flutter create wms_mobile
cd wms_mobile
# Add HTTP package for API calls
flutter pub add http
```

## Current PWA Configuration

The application already includes:
- `manifest.json` for app installation
- Service worker for offline functionality
- Mobile-responsive design
- Camera integration for barcode scanning

## Installation Instructions

1. **Access the web application**
2. **On mobile browser**: Look for "Add to Home Screen" option
3. **Install**: Follow the browser prompts
4. **Use**: Launch from home screen like a native app

The PWA approach provides 90% of native app functionality without requiring app store deployment.
