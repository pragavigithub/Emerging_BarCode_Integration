# ðŸš¨ IMMEDIATE BUILD FIX APPLIED

## Problem Resolved
Fixed "Java home supplied is invalid" error by removing empty org.gradle.java.home setting.

## Next Steps
1. Clear Gradle cache: `cd android && gradlew clean`
2. Run build: `npx react-native run-android`

Your build should now work with your Java 22 installation using Java 17 compatibility mode.
