# URGENT FIX: Inventory Transfer Database Error

## What's Happening
Your application is crashing with this error:
```
Unknown column 'inventory_transfer_items.qc_status' in 'field list'
```

## Root Cause
Your MySQL database is missing required columns that were added to the application code but never migrated to the database.

## IMMEDIATE SOLUTION

### Option A: Run SQL Commands Directly
1. Open your MySQL client (phpMyAdmin, MySQL Workbench, or command line)
2. Copy the contents of `direct_mysql_commands.txt`
3. Paste and execute the SQL commands
4. Restart your Flask application

### Option B: Run Migration Script
```bash
# Set your MySQL connection details
export MYSQL_HOST=localhost
export MYSQL_USER=root
export MYSQL_PASSWORD=your_password
export MYSQL_DATABASE=wms_database

# Run the migration
python mysql_inventory_transfer_migration.py
```

### Option C: Manual Database Update
If you have phpMyAdmin or similar tool:

1. Go to `inventory_transfer_items` table
2. Add column: `qc_status` VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'pending'
3. Go to `inventory_transfers` table  
4. Add columns:
   - `qc_approver_id` INT
   - `qc_approved_at` DATETIME
   - `qc_notes` TEXT
